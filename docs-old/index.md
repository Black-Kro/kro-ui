# Introduction

## What is Kro UI?

Kro UI is a UI library for [VueJS 3.0](https://v3.vuejs.org/) that makes use of the new composition API. This library is designed for modern web browsers and as such requires modern web platform features such as Custom CSS Properties. Kro UI provides the majority of the basic UI components you will need to build your web app. This library is currently still a work in progress so some documentation may be lacking.

## Getting Started

::: tip
Kro UI assumes prior knowledge to Vue 3.0, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. If you are new to Vue 3.0, 
please have a look at the [official documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/) before proceeding.
:::

To see what Kro UI can do, have a look at the further documentation on this site. It will give full examples
of how to use components, composables, and will also give more advanced examples.

If you are looking to install Kro UI in an existing project or create a new project with Kro UI preinstalled, have a look at the installation guide.
