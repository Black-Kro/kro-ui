# Composables
Composables are a new concept to VueJS 3.0. Kro UI provides a few different composables that you may find useful when creating 
applications. While composables can be convenient for quickly creating dialogs or notifications, it is more limited in its styling
and DOM content.

- [useDialog](/composables/useDialog) - Create dialogs in your code without any markup.
- [useToast](/composables/useToast) - Generate a toast notification.
