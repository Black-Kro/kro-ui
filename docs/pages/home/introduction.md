# Introduction
Kro UI is a UI library for [VueJS 3.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) that makes use of the composition API. This library
is meant for modern web browsers as it uses modern web platform features like Custom CSS Properties. Kro UI provides the majority
of the basic UI component you will need to build your web app. This library is currently still a work in progress so some documentation
may be sparse.
