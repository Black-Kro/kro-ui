# Introduction

<kro-logo></kro-logo>

Kro UI is a UI library for VueJS 3.0 that makes use of the new composition API. This library is designed for modern web browsers and as such requires modern web platform features such as Custom CSS Properties. Kro UI provides the majority of the basic UI components you will need to build your web app. This library is currently still a work in progress so some documentation may be lacking.
