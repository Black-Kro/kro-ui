# Dialogs
Dialogs are used to display important information requiring the users immediate attention, often to confirm an action or to display an important error message, and should only be used when necessary. Dialogs will always be shown on top of everything else. The dialog can be dismissed by clicking on the overlay, pusing the escape key, or using the custom
close function provided by the dialog and wiring it up to a button.
