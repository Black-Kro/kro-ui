# App
`kro-app` is the base component required for building apps with Kro UI. It enables functionality within many of the built-in components in Kro UI, most of which won't work without it. It should be used as the root component of your app and only one instance of it is required.

## Usage
```html
<template>
    <kro-app>
        <!-- Your App Content -->
    </kro-app>
</template>
```
